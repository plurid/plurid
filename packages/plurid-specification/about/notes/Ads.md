# Ads

If the page creator wishes so, the `<plurid-page>` can have an attribute `adsId` obtained from `ads.plurid.com`.

The `adsId` signifies that the page will have ads.

At generation/render time, in the `<plurid-controls>` bar at the top of the page the `Ads` button is inserted.

Clicking the `Ads` button creates a normal plurid plane of content with 3 or 6 boxes advertising various products. Clicking on each of the boxes creates an additional plurid plane from where the user can obtain additional information (product details and specifications, comparisons, reviews, and so forth), or even buy the product if inclined to do so.

The boxes are of a regular shape and are black and white, motionless until hover. On hover, the colors of the ad are rendered, or the ad is played if it is an animation (.gif, video).

Below the boxes there is a button `Get other ads`. The ads will be obtained from `ads.plurid.com` following the rules of semi-randomized or athematic serendipitous marketing.
