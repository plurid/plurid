The page's uniqueness can be determined by the path, or the id.

If page ids are not provided the paths must be unique.

If ids are provided for all the pages, the pages can have similar paths, but the Plurid Links must use ids to link.

Once a page is loaded it will not be updated (to pass properties to the page use the page context).

Pages can be generated at runtime and passed into the pages array property. Documents can also be generated at runtime.
