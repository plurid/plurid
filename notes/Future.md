# Future


+ a 3D cube to for quick selection of front-back-left-right planes

+ quick fit for view (2 plurids side by side, all plurids side by side etc.)

+ `<plurid-sheet>`, `<plurid-sheet-double>`, `<plurid-solid>` with modifiable, non-rectangular general form;

+ to be able to `shift + click` multiple `plurid`s to select them and apply the same transform further on;

+ the idea of sittings: to record for each tab a history, the recording starts when the tab is open, and ends when the tab is closed. interactions are saved in encrypted format. the user can play the recording as in the Software Recorder system (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RipIs-22rwA)

+ to have one or more `<plurid-roots>` in the same `<plurid-container>`

+ the `<plurid-bridge>` can be extended in a snake-like shape
